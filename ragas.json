A M.Sc. student may be granted only casual, medical, and semester/term leave. 5.1. Personal Leave and Casual Leave 5.1.1. A postgraduate student may take a maximum of 30 days of personal leave in an academic year (including winter break and mid-semester breaks) such that no more than 10 days of leave are taken during a semester. However, this 10-day cap will not be enforced when semesters are not in progress and during the summer term. Leave not availed in one academic year may be carried over to the next academic year up to a maximum of 15 days.  5.1.2. In addition, a student may be allowed casual leave for up to 6 days during a semester and 4 days during the summer term. The casual leave cannot be carried over. 5.1.3. There will be no loss of financial assistantship for students going on personal or casual leave. 5.1.4. Weekends or gazetted holidays falling within the period of the leave will be counted as personal leave but will not be counted as casual leave. Suppose, if a student applies for personal leave from Friday to Monday, then Saturday and Sunday will be counted in the leave period, i.e, a total of four days will be counted as leave. However, if a student applies for casual leave from Friday to Monday, then Saturday and Sunday will not be counted in the leave period, i.e, a total of two days will be counted as leave.  5.2. Medical Leave Leave on medical ground, duly supported by a medical certificate, may be granted to a student for up to 8 days per semester and 4 days during the summer term. Leave not availed may be carried over to the next semester/term up to a maximum of 8 days in the case of carry over to semester and 4 days in the case of carry over to term. However, at a stretch, the medical leave shall not exceed 15 days during a semester and 8 days during the summer term. Such leave shall not entail any loss of financial assistantship.  5.3. Maternity Leave/Paternity leave 5.3a. Maternity Leave A female student may be granted maternity leave for a maximum of 180 days each for up to two children. Leave up to 6 weeks can also be granted for miscarriage including medical termination of pregnancy, if supported by a proper medical certificate. Such leave can be combined with any other leave due and will not entail any loss of financial assistantship. Such leave applications are subjected to the approval of Chairperson, SPGC. If the candidate has availed maternity leave during registration period, registration may be allowed retrospectively. 5.3b. Paternity Leave A male student may be granted paternity leave for a maximum of 15 working days each for up to two children. Such leave can be combined with any other leave due and will not entail any loss of financial assistantship. Such leave applications are subjected to the approval of Chairperson, SPGC. 5.4. Semester Leave/Term Leave Semester leave for up to a maximum of two semesters and a summer term for M.Tech./M.Des./M.S. by Research/Ph.D. students may be sanctioned for bonafide reasons. Except for medical reasons, such leave would not normally be sanctioned before a student has completed his/her minimum total credit requirements and in no case before the student has spent two semesters and a summer term in the programme. However, on medical considerations such leave may be sanctioned after his/her stay of one semester. Leave for more than one semester/term at a time will not be granted. No semester leave will be granted to D.IIT. students. 5.5.

            "4.i. The student in the external registration programme who has completed the requirements as laid \r\ndown in Section 7.1 under footnote 2 can register for the next semester anytime starting from one week \r\nprior to the end of the current semester (i.e., the semester in which he/she fulfills the requirements as \r\nlaid down in Section 7.1 under footnote 2) or the date of being awarded grades for the current semester, \r\nwhichever is later, till the late registration date of the next semester. \r\n(18) \r\n \r\n4.1. Late Registration  \r\n4.1.1. If for any compelling reason like illness, a student is unable to register on the day of registration, \r\nhe/she will be allowed to register on the day of late registration specified in the academic calendar \r\n(which is about one week from the date of registration). Any student registering late will be required to \r\npay the specified late registration fee.  \r\n4.1.2. In exceptional cases, the SPGC on the recommendation of the DPGC may consider registration \r\nbeyond the date of late registration. In such a case, the student will be allowed to register for thesis \r\ncredits only.  \r\n4.2. Academic Advising  \r\n4.2.1. A student will be advised in the selection of courses by the registration adviser appointed by the \r\nDPGC of the concerned department. A student registering for thesis credits must have a thesis \r\nsupervisor assigned to him/her.  \r\n4.2.2. Except for M.Sc. students, a student may be permitted to repeat or substitute courses in which \r\nhe/she has obtained D+, D, E, F, or X grades. A M.Sc. student can only repeat courses in which s/he has \r\nobtained E/F/X grades. Permission to repeat/substitute a course will be governed by the guidelines laid \r\ndown in Section 7.6. The request for repeat or substitution of a course must be given in writing duly \r\nendorsed by the DPGC to the Academic Section at the time of registration. \r\n4.3. Semester Load Requirements   \r\n4.3.1. The normal semester load is defined as equivalent of 36 credits. For a well-merited case, the \r\nSPGC may permit a student to register for a maximum of 45 credits or a minimum of 27 credits.  \r\n4.3.2. The normal semester load for a part-time student is equivalent of 18 credits. For a well-merited \r\ncase, the SPGC may permit a student to register for a maximum of 36 credits and a minimum of 17 \r\ncredits during a regular semester. A part-time M.S. by Research student employed on a sponsored \r\nresearch project in the Institute may register for 36 credits, if he/she is only registered for thesis credits \r\nand his/her thesis work is aligned with the project work. If a part-time M.S. by Research student gets \r\nfinancial assistance from the department/IDP or the Institute, he/she must register as a full-time student. \r\n4.3.3. A student in the external registration programme when registering for thesis research, to be carried \r\nout at his/her organization, can register for a maximum of 27 credits or a minimum of 9 credits during \r\nthe regular semester.  \r\n4.3.4. Notwithstanding the provisions of 4.3.1, a normal semester load is defined as equivalent of 60 \r\ncredits for an MBA student. For a well-merited case, the SPGC may permit a student to register for a \r\nmaximum of 70 credits and a minimum of 40 credits. \r\n4.3.5. Notwithstanding the provisions of 4.3.1, a normal semester load is defined as equivalent of 50 \r\ncredits for MSc/MSPD student. For a well-merited case, the SPGC may permit a student to register for a \r\nmaximum of 65 credits and a minimum of 35 credits. \r\n4.4. Summer-Term Registration  \r\nA student is required to register in the summer term for up to a maximum of half the normal semester \r\nload except in the case of a M.Sc. student. A M.Sc. student may choose to register for a maximum of 27 \r\n(19) \r\ncredits. The students in the external registration program and the students who are waiting for the \r\ndefense of their thesis are not required to register for the summer term. Part time students may apply for \r\nwaiver for summer term registration. The request should be duly recommended by the supervisor and \r\nDPGC, Convenor. A waiver be granted upon an explicit request by the individual. \r\n4.5."
